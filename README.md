The customer churn data for a bank is provided along with the information of customers such as the number of accounts they have, how active the customer is with their financial activity, and the demographic features of the customer. A suitable machine learning model must be developed to predict if the customer will stay with the current bank or leave based on the selected features that impact the customer churn.
The column names are the following: 
CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary and Exited.
Random forest and LightGBM classifiers will be used in Python.
